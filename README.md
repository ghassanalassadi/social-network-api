## Description
This application is a basic back-end for a social media site. Users can be created, edited and deleted. Friends can also be added and removed. Posts are made in the form of 'thoughts' and they can be edited and deleted also. Comments to 'thoughts' are called reactions, which can be created and deleted.

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder path in the command line and then  run `node index.js`. Use an application such as Insomnia to execute the desired functions.
